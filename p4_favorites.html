	<br>
	<pre><b> Alita </b>
	A city is divided into the rich and the poor, the rich live on a separate land above the poor. Whatever the rich doesn't 
	want anymore, they throw away, and it ends up in the poors land, where the junkyard is. There is a doctor who lives in 
	the poor place, he is exploring through the junkyard looking for parts of cyborgs or any equipment he thinks he can use 
	for his clinic, when he found a cyborg head, with it's brain still intact and functioning. So he took the head to try to 
	revive it. The doctor already had a cyborg body, which was meant for his daughter who was paralyzed, but she unfortunatly 
	died. So the doctor used the body for the cyborg head, which worked and now the cyborg is alive. When she woke up, she 
	didnt know what was happening, but she saw clothes, put them on. Then saw a mirror, and decided to look into it, and she
	sees herself for the first time. Since she already had a brain, that means she was already alive, but she doesn't 
	remember anything about her past life.
